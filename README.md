    How to use
  </summary>
  <br>
  This repo is not much for use as it is experimentation. <br> In <code>index.js</code>, you will see a json schema near the top of the file.  To edit questions, simply add or remove items from the schema.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE: Every question must have four answers otherwise the program will return an error.</strong>
